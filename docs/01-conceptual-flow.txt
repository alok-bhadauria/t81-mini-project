CONCEPTUAL FLOW:

---------------------------------------------------------------------

01. Input Handling:

User provides input in text or speech form.
If speech → audio is converted into text.
System continues processing only clean textual input.

Example:
Speech: "I am happy today"
Converted Text: "I am happy today"

---------------------------------------------------------------------

02. Text Normalization:

Text is standardized to ensure consistent linguistic processing.
Operations:
• Remove unnecessary symbols
• Standardize case
• Expand contractions

Example:
"I’m VERY happy today!!!"
→ "i am very happy today"

---------------------------------------------------------------------

03. Linguistic Analysis:

Sentence is analyzed to extract grammatical components.
Identified Elements:
• Subject
• Verb
• Object
• Time markers
• Question type

Example:
Sentence: "I am happy today"
• Subject = I
• Verb = am (auxiliary) + happy
• Time marker = today
• Type = Statement

---------------------------------------------------------------------

04. ASL Grammar Transformation:

English grammatical structure is converted into simplified ASL structure using rule-based reordering.
Applied Rules:
• Move Time expressions to beginning
• Remove auxiliary verbs
• Convert to Subject–Object–Verb order
• Move WH-words to end
• Mark Yes/No questions for non-manual signal

Example 1 (Time Rule):
"I am happy today"
→ "TODAY I HAPPY"

Example 2 (WH Rule):
"Where are you going?"
→ "YOU GO WHERE"

---------------------------------------------------------------------

05. Gesture Mapping:

Each ASL token is mapped to a predefined sign vocabulary.
Every word corresponds to a unique Gesture ID.

Example:
ASL Tokens: "TODAY I HAPPY"
Mapping:
• TODAY → G101
• I → G002
• HAPPY → G305
Output:
[G101, G002, G305]

---------------------------------------------------------------------

06. Emotion Classification:

Entire sentence is classified to determine a single Emotion ID.
Emotion controls facial expressions and non-manual signals.

Example 1:
"I am very happy today"
Emotion = Excited → E5

Example 2:
"Where are you going?"
Emotion = Question → E6

---------------------------------------------------------------------

07. Backend Output:

Backend generates structured response data.
Output Components:
• Ordered list of Gesture IDs
• Single Emotion ID

Example Output:
• Gesture Sequence: [G101, G002, G305]
• Emotion ID: E5

---------------------------------------------------------------------

08. Frontend Rendering:

Frontend loads base 3D avatar.
Gesture animations are fetched using Gesture IDs.
Emotion animation is applied globally.
Animations are blended smoothly and rendered sequentially.

Example Final Flow:
Input: "I am happy today"
ASL Structure: "TODAY I HAPPY"
Gesture IDs: [G101, G002, G305]
Emotion: E5
Output: Avatar signs TODAY → I → HAPPY with excited facial expression.
